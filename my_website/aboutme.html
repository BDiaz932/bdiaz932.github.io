    <p> Hello, my name is Brian Diaz. I am 15 years old, my birthday is on October 12th and I am a student at the Palmdale Aerospace Academy. My favorite color is green, and my favorite subject is english. My goal for junior year is to continue getting straight A's. I don't really play any sports but if I had to pick one I would pick baseball. </p>
